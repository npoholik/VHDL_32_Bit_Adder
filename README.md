# VHDL_32_Bit_Adder

> A demonstration of functionally similar 32-bit adders but different in simulation timing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this code is to provide two 32-bit adder designs, which will demonstrate how different approaches yields different timing/efficiency results
